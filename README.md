Java Spring Boot Backend Application for Travel Card.
A Travel Card is a credit-card-sized stored-value contactless smartcard that can hold prepaid funds to pay for fares on buses and trains within one or more of four "zones". 
The credit must be added to the card before travel. 
Passengers "tag on" and "tag off" their card on using the mobile application at the metro station or buses when entering and leaving the transport system
in order to validate it or deduct funds.
