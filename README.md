Java Spring Boot Backend Application for Travel Card.<br />
A Travel Card is a credit-card-sized stored-value contactless smartcard that can hold prepaid funds to pay for fares on buses and trains within one or more of four "zones". <br />
The credit must be added to the card before travel. <br />
Passengers "tag on" and "tag off" their card on using the mobile application at the metro station or buses when entering and leaving the transport system<br />
in order to validate it or deduct funds. <br />
